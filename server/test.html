There was silence among the crowd, holding their breaths then the sound of
computer “Level 100 cleared”.<br /><br />“Woooooh!!” The crowd around him was
cheering.<br /><br />“Unbelievable, I spend 2 days playing in level 90 and I
still can’t clear the stage and you. You cleared the whole game man!” still
shocked while praising.<br /><br />“Well if you follow the pattern you can do it
also.” Kai said standing and getting ready to leave.<br /><br />“I know what you
said is true but it was so fast I can’t follow the pattern you told me!” Ren Liu
a young man barely more than five feet eight inches tall, skinny, pale skinned,
brown eyed and dark haired with tint of brown. Sigh as he said that.<br /><br />“It’s
ok Ren. I can’t also clear the game like you.” Max said as he pat Ren shoulder.
Maximus Forester was a six feet three inches tall with muscular built young man,
blond hair, rugged and strong with crystal blue eyes. “You also know it that Kai
reflexes and instinct is top notch.” Looking to Kai grinning. “You can’t compare
yourself to him. He’s a master class.”<br /><br />Ren looking back at Max
smiling face shrugged and went “I guess so” in response.<br /><br />“Hey, don’t
compare me to a master. Ren you’re better than me in terms of academics and I
still can’t defeat my Grandpa back home in Chichibu. He’s practically
unbeatable.” Kai instantly cut in. Kai Kudou was a bit taller than Ren handsome
young man, light blue hair paired with intelligent blue-gray eyes, medium built
with no extra fat in the muscles, not wasting extra movement when moving and
like a martial artist with casual feline grace.<br /><br />“You were not
studying at all and you still received high grades. I know you were holding back
but I don’t know why. You can…”<br /><br />Max suddenly cut in asking. “When is
the time you last seen your Grandpa?”<br /><br />Kai doesn't have a response to
Ren.<br /><br />“I guess around two years ago.” Kai looking at the window
feeling nostalgic about the place back home. <br /><br />‘It’s been two years
now eh?’ he sighed. “Come on let’s go home!” He gets his bag and turning around,
walking to the door cutting the conversation about his life back at Chichibu
Mountains.<br /><br />Ren suddenly looked back at Max.<br /><br />Max shaking
his head with disagreement to him and Ren suddenly sighs.<br /><br />Kai open
the door turned around and said. “There is still Virtual reality game to
conquer.” Kai said smiling at his friends.<br /><br />Ren and Max suddenly
looked at Kai in front of the door with smile appearing at their face.
“Yeah!”<br /><br />The most awaited game in the world, the first Virtual reality
game. Every gamer wants to experience it their self, saving the Kingdom from
evil, slaying the Dragon, defeating the Demon King, saving the Princess from
Evil Witch, becoming a King, a Hero, occupying territories to become the Emperor
of the whole continent that not even Genghis Khan, Alexander the Great and
Julius Caesar can do in history.<br /><br />Virtual reality game! A place where
a person moves their body means you can act like in real life. Royal Road and
like its name to walked the path of the emperor with serenity. Possessing more
than 75% of the world’s game market share, and obviously more than 90% of Asian
gamers will played this game. <br /><br />Especially during beta test and
preview about the game, it came to a point where it overwhelmed the viewership
of all other networks in other countries. The only game in the world where is
anyone could obtain fame, power and wealth. Royal Road was the result of an
ingenious system interlocking with virtual reality.<br /><br />They waited for
this kind of game to release until last year on TV. Unicorn Corporations creator
of Royal Road released to the public the first VRMMORPG. After the announcement
on TV, they ordered immediately the capsule in order to play the game. No time
to think if the game will be good or popular to other gamers because time is the
essence, first order first serve. <br /><br />The capsule Kai ordered was
delivered a month ago. He went home immediately last month as the engineer set
up the capsule in the corner of his room. The engineer gave him guidelines and
manual on how to operate the capsule. The engineer said there is no language
barrier and he can operate it in any language the AI knows.<br /><br /><br />The
three of them became friends because of games especially the MMORPG who need
party to complete the dungeons and quests. They didn’t know each other until
freshman year in the first day of class when Ren sitting beside Kai brought the
Game PAD during break time and playing Legendary Heroes one of the popular RPG
games in Japan until last year.<br /><br />“You need to drag the boss to the
spring and use Ice magic to defeat it.” Kai said as Ren was struggling to fight
boss with his powerful magic spells until his mana depletes, but the Fire Titan
keeps regenerating HP using the fire surrounding it.<br /><br />Ren looked at
his right side with puzzled looked. “What do you mean?” Kai repeated what he
said, and Ren do it step by step as he guide him.<br /><br />Then the computer
said with low pitch voice. “Fire Titan has been defeated. You gain title The
Titan Slayer”<br /><br />Ren was still shocked looking at his Game PAD, and then
looked back at his right side. “Water was still a weakness of Fire even though
it’s hot.” Kai said with a smile on his face.<br /><br />“I’m Kaito Kudou, you
can call me Kai.” He said as he extends his right hand.<br /><br />“I’m Ren Liu,
you can also call me Ren if you want.” Ren with narrow eye said with a smile on
his face and response with his right hand.<br /><br />That’s when the two of
them became friends. They talked about the Legendary Heroes and other games,
shared knowledge and tactics. Max who was sitting behind Ren heard them as he
joined in also and said that he was also having problem about the game. He
stand-up and joined them introducing himself.<br /><br />“I’m Maximus Forester,
my friends call me Max.” Max introduced himself.<br /><br />Since then, they
spend their time at school together playing during break time and playing mostly
MMORPG at home where they can party together during quests, dungeon, siege and
hunting. When they don’t have club activities they hang-out after school at
someone place or challenge players at game center.<br /><br />The Teito Private
Academy High School is one of the elite high schools in Japan located in Kanto,
Tokyo. It was considered a type of school that guaranteed promising universities
around the world. Most of the students here are born of high class nobles; some
are prince and princess from other countries. The unique about Teito Private
Academy from other elite High School is that it isn't only focus is about
getting good in academic subjects, you also need to be train to become mentally
and physically fit. The school teaches and trains the students in different
sports and martial arts they chose. <br /><br />The student need to at least
join one club related to sports aside from P.E. they teach during class. The
room was floor apart to avoid other students from other room to disturb other
classes, the chairs and table was built like an old theatre and there is also a
platform in the front for demonstration and a board for writing.<br /><br /><br /><br />As
they walked out the Game Center they said goodbye at the owner and said it will
be a long time till they come back again. The owner although feel a little sad
he still smile and said. “I’ll be waiting, come back again.”<br /><br />They
chat as they walk to the parking area, talking about Royal Road that will start
tomorrow midnight. Bidding farewell to each other they head to their own car;
Mazda MX-series, Geely Tiger GT and Ford Mustang GT.<br /><br />After twenty
five minutes driving, Kai arrived at the front of his house. He parks his car
inside the parking lot beside the garden and closing the gate, a black Doberman
welcome him wagging its tail circling around him. He pats, rubs its head and
neck, Bolter responds to Kai as he licks his hands and face.<br /><br />Kai head
inside the house but it was quiet and dark. It was a two story building with one
room at first floor, three rooms at second floor and a basement. He lives alone
that can house one family. He goes to the kitchen and gets the pet food for
Bolter and his other pets. He put the dog food down to the bowl of Bolter and
Kai head to the living room where he feed his fish on the aquarium, and lastly
he goes to the backyard and feed his four birds, the two small pairs are the
cockatiels and the biggest pair is the hawk-head parrots.<br /><br />After
watching the birds eating for five minutes, he looked at the sky and where he
can see the moon and stars shining above him as there are no clouds blocking
them. “There's still time.” He said.<br /><br />It was 7:20PM, Kai go back
inside the house and he change his attire at his room to gym clothes, black
sleeveless shirt and blue gym pants as he walk down to his basement with towel
on his left shoulder and water bottle at his left hand. He opened the door to
his basement activating the light in the wall of the stairs.<br /><br />Bolter
barks at him, Kai looking back he said to Bolter. “Just be quiet okay?!” as he
rubs Bolter head.<br /><br />“Argh!” Bolter respond and Kai walk down the stairs
together with Bolter.<br /><br /><br />“Kai-kun, be a good boy and always listen
to Grandpa and Papa for Mama ok?!” she hugs Kai tightly and tear drops from her
eyes.<br /><br />“Sob-sob, don’t go away Mama, I promise I’ll be a good boy.
Sob-sob” Kai said as water pour out from his eyes and nose.<br /><br />“I know
you will Kai-kun, promise me that you will become strong.” He nodded and she
gently kiss Kai forehead and said “I love you!”<br /><br />As she stands, Kai
still holds on her hands and she regrettably removes her hands from him. She
started walking away from him not looking back and still can hear him crying
calling her “Mama” again and again.<br /><br />“Mama! Mama!” Kai was still
calling her mother but it seems her mother can’t hear him. He can’t run to her
cause his father was holding him tightly. As her mother rides the car he was
still crying her name.<br /><br />Kai open his eyes and said. “It’s been a long
time since I dream about my mother.”<br /><br />He checks the time and its
5:00AM he has still time for morning exercise. He gets up, arranges his bed,
wash his face, brush his teeth and change his clothes. As he open the door,
Bolter was there and waiting. <br /><br />“Argh!” as Bolter barks.<br /><br />“Good
Morning Bolter!” Kai answered as he rubs the head of Bolter.<br /><br />Kai head
to the kitchen and drinks a glass of water and head to the entrance of the door.
As he puts his shoes he goes out for morning exercises and Bolter who was always
following him behind when he jogs in the morning was with him.<br /><br />Kai
with his dog Bolter was walking along the neighborhood. It was still dark
outside however, he always chose the time when the sky is just about brighten up
for his daily jogging routine. He heads to the nearby park for his starting
point in jogging, he stretch his limbs first before start jogging at slower
pace.<br /><br />Kai followed by Bolter was jogging at fast rate now, he checks
his watch and notices that he was jogging for 15 minutes now and start running
full speed for another 1 hour. After that he was panting as he heads home, his
dog that was following him was panting as well. As they reached home he goes to
the kitchen and empties the three glasses of water and he gave some to his dog
also.<br /><br />After taking a bath he feed his pets and prepares breakfast for
him. After eating three bowls of fried rice, fried egg, noodle soup with pork
meat, piece of bread and cheese he sets off to school with his car. He gave few
reminders to Bolter to watches the house for him before he enters the parking
lot and the dog answer with a bark.<br /><br /><br />It was mid-March and last
day of his third term in sophomore year. As he arrived at school and drives to
the parking lot and parks his car. The morning sun gave off bright rays. The
clear blue sky had not a single cloud. The people around him were murmuring with
each other but he could hear what they are talking.<br /><br />“It’s tonight the
released of Royal Road, I can’t wait to play and I can’t sleep last night cause
of it.” said one of the male students to his friends.<br /><br />“Yeah me too
I’m excited to play also, I’m waiting for it for almost a year now.” his friend
agrees at him also.<br /><br />“I’m happy for you guys but I still need to wait
till next week before I can play.” one of the student said as he sighed.<br /><br />“Oh
yeah sorry, But its ok we will all start at the same city and will help you to
catch up with us.” they comfort their friend as he wasn't lucky enough to get a
capsule in early batch.<br /><br />Some of the people who want to play the game
can’t start the same day as the others because the Unicorn released only 100,000
capsules worldwide on first batch and didn’t think on the first week of the
public announcement all the capsule was sold already and others reserved for the
next batch of capsule. As he and his friends they ordered during the day after
the announcement on public about the VMMORPG being released. Among the first
batch that got the capsule already can play Royal Road tonight as they all wait
for the time of opening.<br /><br />“Kai, you’re as early as usual.” Max greeted
him with a smile after he saw Kai right away.<br /><br />“Yeah I happened to
wake up early today as usual.” Kai waited for his friend to catch up to him as
he smiles also and greeted Max.<br /><br />“Eh, the people sure are noisy and
excited to play Royal Road quickly as they can.” Max amused as he watches the
surrounding students around them.<br /><br />“Can’t blame them Max, I’m also
excited to play Royal Road right away.” Kai answered as if it was the normal
thing.<br /><br />They walked to the building for sophomore students where they
see the beautiful garden surrounding the school building and beside the walls,
the school building lined with elegant spires seemed very much like a palace for
nobles. Advanced facility, all rooms were air-conditioned the food was free from
five-star restaurants in the dining area and a couple of café stores with
deserts also around the dining area. <br /><br />On grounds around the school
they can see students in different variation of uniform of different clubs.
Speaking of clubs last month Kai won the first place on open weight division in
karate, Max was still undefeated in lightweight division in boxing and Ren rank
first in 500 meter dash in track and field. <br /><br />It’s not rare experience
that the students of Teito Academy won the competitions in different sports. It
was a common thing here in Teito Academy to win most sports. Although it’s not
easy for Teito Academy to win competition that other schools and audience
watching yearly was saying, the students need to work harder in training than
other schools. Even though you got talent it doesn’t mean you can win the
competition, training was still the fundamentals to win in the competition. All
the students representing their clubs in the competition feels pressure from the
audience watching, media covering every match and for the name of the school
that has a title of the ‘strongest high school’. On rare occasion that there’s a
club didn’t won the championship they cut the budget of that club though money
is not a problem as most of them are rich but the leader or captain of that club
will be replace. They will also train on weekends and during break until they
won a competition. That’s why all the members of different club and their
instructor trains harder and don’t accept defeat, that was the mindset and rules
for so many decades now.<br /><br />They arrived at their classroom and they see
their other friend Ren that was busy browsing his tablet and seriously reading
about something. They called out to their friend but they didn’t receive a
response so they approached him closely and called him again.<br /><br />“Oh
it’s you guys, come here check this on.” He said pointing at the tablet.<br /><br />“What
is it? Is it about Royal Road?” Kai ask because he also checks the net early
this morning and most of the news is about Royal Road. There’s no other big news
other than Royal Road and he didn’t bother other VMMORPG that other company
planning also to release.<br /><br />“Yeah what’s taking that seriously if it
isn’t about Royal Road.” Max added as he also leaned over to see what’s Ren
being agitated at.<br /><br />“Just read it from the top, and you guys will know
why I’m being like this.” Ren said as he gives the two some space to read what's
written in the tablet.<br /><br />The news is about the character Weed from the
Continent of Magic from Korea that sold his account with the price of
3,090,000,000 won.<br /><br />The two was also shocked at the price the account
sold for, and they scroll down and read the details and comments after a few
seconds they regained their composure.<br /><br />“That was big news especially
in history of gaming.” Kai commented on the news.<br /><br />“Totally there’s no
one in history sold their game account at that high price.” Max added as he was
also amazed.<br /><br />“Yeah I just read the news earlier while I’m browsing
about games when this news appeared, at first it seems like a joke but when I
read the contents I’m also shocked that it was true.” Ren said as he was still
feeling amazed at the news he just read.<br /><br />“The bidding also happened
last night and I didn’t know about it.” Kai said with regret.<br /><br />“Right,
because you don’t have any interest in other games other than Royal Road.” Max
agreed on Kai.<br /><br />“I also don’t have interest in other games right now
aside from Royal Road.” Ren added.<br /><br />They don’t need the character or
account they just feel regret as they can’t witness the legend unfolds.<br /><br />“Well
guys it’s ok, it’s not like we need to win the bidding for that account.” Kai
said smiling at his friends.<br /><br />“Yeah it’s no used for us who are going
to play Royal Road.” Ren respond agreeing with Kai.<br /><br />“That’s right
it’s the game we are waiting for the year now.” Max said smiling as he added.<br /><br />“We
will also probably meet that person in the game, that’s why he sold his account
to play Royal Road.” Kai was saying to his friends that they got professional
gamer playing Royal Road with a title ‘God of War’ in Continent of Magic.<br /><br />They
all feel excited because the more rivals you got the more difficult and exciting
the game is. They all want to experienced thrill and excitement that no other
games or competition can give. All the games they played in the past was all
easy for them, they got bored and ended up quitting after some time. Same for
the competition held in school and outside they felt winning was like a chore
for them and that’s not what they want. They tried and search different things
until Unicorn released Royal Road on public with 99% realization, a truly
splendid game. Beginning with a fully implemented world, the game contained tens
of thousands of races and over tens of thousands of jobs and hundreds of
thousands of skills.<br /><br />You could enjoy adventure as you desire or even
go sea fishing with friends for days, as long you don’t encounter whimsical
typhoons of course. The massive scale of freedom was amazing, but best above all
was the wondrous game’s system. Royal Road had the reputation of inducing the
ultimate fun a human could enjoy in a game.<br /><br /><br />The normal school
day pass and as the bell ring for the end of the class their teacher dismissed
them. The students are starting to get out of the room although they are not
running they are moving quickly and with hurry. <br /><br />Kai was putting his
bag and getting ready to leave the room when he was approached by three girls.
The girl in front of them was Rikka her long black hair was silky and beautiful,
and her features did not lose to that either. Her build was slender, but she
looked like the type that seemed slimmer in clothes. <br /><br />The two behind
her is Rin and Chisa, the one besides her urging her to talk was Rin her hair
was drawn up in a ponytail seemed more coffee brown than black, almost the color
of black pearls. She did not dye her hair; it had been that color since birth.
She was as beautiful and it wasn't just beauty her face projected an air of
refined nobility, her eyes shone with clear intelligence.<br /><br />“Hello
Captain, Rikka has something to tell you.” Rin said as she turns to Rikka beside
her. “Come on ask him now.” She is also a member of Karate club, her dark brown
hair swayed as she moved, Rin said as she pushes Rikka in front of him.<br /><br />“Um”
Rikka didn’t know how to start as she forgets the scripts in the practiced
earlier.<br /><br />“You’re Rikka right?” Kai ask as he remembered Rikka the
girl in front of him. She possessed beautiful soft black hair that was long and
shiny with blue-green eyes, as well as an appearance of a quintessential Yamato
Nadeshiko.<br /><br />“Y-Yes, I’m Rikka you’re classmate. I have something to
ask of you.” Rikka said stuttering with her words.<br /><br />“Go Rikka-chan you
can do it!” Said Chisa on her back she has pink hair at shoulder length and a
slim body like a model because of her cute, yet childish face, it wasn't unusual
for people to mistake her for a middle-school girl. She is also a member of
Taekwondo club, on his school uniform she looks harmless but during her match
she transforms to a demon that defeat her opponents.<br /><br />“You see, I
wanted to ask you earlier before class, but you guys are busy and seriously
talking about something so I didn’t disturb you.” Rikka said explaining. “Now
before you leave I wanted to ask you something, It’s about the virtual reality
game you were going to play the Royal Road, you see we also brought a capsule a
while ago and wanted to ask you where are you guys going to start, what’s the
name of the city and if possible we wanted to join you guys in adventure.” Rikka
said embarrassingly as her face turn crimson red. <br /><br />Rikka is a member
of kendo club she likes Kai and always watches his match. Last spring they went
on shopping on Ueno when an accident occur as the little girl chase the cat on
the road and with many fast car was passing through, before the car hit the
little girl a young man jump on the road to save the little girl and also the
cat. She was also running to save the little girl with his two friends but they
were too late but they notices that the little girl was okay and also the cat as
they were being carried by a tall light blue haired young man. The little girl
who was crying earlier but when she saw the face of the young man who was
carrying him with the cat at his shoulders started talking and smiling at her,
she stops crying and started smiling as she hugs the cat. The guardian of the
young little girl dashed at their daughter as they hug her daughter and thanks
the young man and they also bowed to him. The tall young man with light blue
hair paired with blue gray eyes talk the guardian for a few moments, and then he
walks out the scene as he joined his two friends. Starting from that day she was
love struck to the young man who was in front of her right now.<br /><br />“We
will not slow you down we will be a benefit to your adventure.” Rikka added to
Kai as she looked to him with pleading eyes.<br /><br />Kai seeing the girl in
front of him pleading with cute expression, it was truly adorable. He looked
back at his friends and they just nod indicating that they will accept his
decision.<br /><br />“I truly appreciate of what you said and willing to do for
us, but we will decline.” Kai said looking apologetic to Rikka.<br /><br />“Why?
Is it not enough? Are we not good? Do you hate us?” Rikka said with tears
forming at her eyes as she built her courage to speak with him today but the
result was failed.<br /><br />“No no, you see we plan to start on different
place on Royal Road.” Kai said explaining.<br /><br />“What do you mean, why you
guys need to start on different place? When it was clear to see that when you
guy’s help each other it will be easier.” Rikka asks as she was perplexed at
what Kai said to her.<br /><br />“That’s the point why we decide to start on
different place on Royal Road. If we truly want to feel the true adventure, we
will start on places we don’t know other people. We want to experience the
thrill and excitement during the game, if we start on same places we will just
help each other although it’s not bad to help each other but at first we want to
achieve something ourselves. That’s why we decide before we start the game that
if we truly want to experience true adventure we will start with ourselves first
and then we will decide to meet before the start of new school year. That will
be around two months in real time and eight months during the game.” Kai said to
her.<br /><br />“Eight months? Will that be so long and hard?” Rikka said
feeling sad because she will not also see Kai during that eight months’ time.
Although she take courage herself to get close to him in the Royal Road where
she can help him during adventures because an adventurer needs other people to
help each other and she thinks it was the right time for her to act to get
closed to him but now it will be futile.<br /><br />“I thought Rin know about it
because I also tell my club before the tournament starts a couple of months
ago.” Kai said as Rin and Rikka were friends so they can share some info right
away.<br /><br />“Well Captain when you tell us about it I just thought that
your friends will play at the same town so you want some privacy but I didn’t
know that Captain and his friends will not also start at the same place. I’m
sorry because I’m the one that told Rikka to talk with you about it.” Rin
embarrassingly said apologizing for her mistakes.<br /><br />“No Rin-chan it was
my fault. I’m sorry Kudou-san it wasn’t Rin-chan fault so don’t be angry at
her.” Rikka said as she also bowed and apologizes to him. Chisa seeing her two
friends apologizes she also join them as she bowed also in front of Kai.<br /><br />Seeing
the three girls apologizing with sad face like that Kai sigh and said. “Don’t
worry about it because I’m not angry at anyone and I’m sorry also about
earlier.” Kai said as he apologizes also to the girls. Kai then wears his best
smile and said to them. “Alright why don’t we exchange email address so we can
contact each other after two months and you girls can join our party after we
meet.” After he said that the girls brightened their mood.<br /><br />“Thank you
Captain!” “Yes, thank you Kudou-san!” “Yes, thank you Kudou-san!”<br /><br />They
exchange their email address and remind them that if we contact each other don’t
ask any information about Royal Road and see ya after two months. It was the
last day of the third term and they don’t have any club activities. After they
bid farewell to each other they go home and prepare for Royal Road.<br /><br />Kai
after he got home, he feed his pets and makes heavy dinner for himself and
prepares a breakfast for tomorrow. <br /><br />He checked the net and do light
exercises before he got in the capsule.<br /><br />“It’s time” He said as he
wait inside the capsule that turn dark around him.<br /><br />

Notes<br />This is my first time writing my own fanfic and I’m sorry because
there is no originality in some parts.<br />The next chapter will be released
later or tomorrow after I proofread it. I plan to add some picture, though I
only get it in Google because I don't have time to draw and I’m suck on drawing.
<br />I'm glad to receive any reactions about my writing either it was
criticism, suggestions, corrections and etc. Just feel free to comment and I’ll
try to reply if I’m given time.<br />The volume title will give you some idea
about the next chapter and the whole story is about the Training Grounds though
I’m not good at giving title but I tried my best so the readers can understand
immediately so Neo only and there is no other.<br />Most of the story is not
based in real LMS as I only get the Royal Road game though sometimes story about
the real LMS will pops-up to tell the difference in timeline and other
things.<br />Thank you and enjoy reading!
